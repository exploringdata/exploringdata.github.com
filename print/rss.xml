        <description><![CDATA[A network graph showing 454 programming languages connected by 761 influence relations. Highly influential languages like Lisp, Smalltalk, C, Java, C++, Haskell and Python are shown as larger circles as compared to languages with less influence on others like PHP, Rust and Go. The influence relation data was retrieved from Wikidata December 30, 2019. A great gift for programmers who are into digital art.]]></description>
