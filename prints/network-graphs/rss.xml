        <description><![CDATA[A network graph showing 454 programming languages connected by 761 influence relations. Highly influential languages like Lisp, Smalltalk, C, Java, C++, Haskell and Python are shown as larger circles as compared to languages with less influence on others like PHP, Rust and Go. The influence relation data was retrieved from Wikidata December 30, 2019. A great gift for programmers who are into digital art.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[A network graph showing 279 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants and how they are connected to their sister cities within this set. The cities are the nodes which are sized by degree and colored by population and the 852 edges show the sister relation. The data for creating this graph was retrieved from Wikidata in April 2018.]]></description>

        <link><![CDATA[https://exploring-data.com/print/programmers-forceatlas2/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[This graph shows the connections of programmers based on searches performed on Google in March 2013. The graph consists of 561 nodes and 1311 edges. To be included a person's search result page on Google needed to have knowledge graph information indicating the person being a programmer. The creators of the top programming languages according to GitHub served as seed values for searches, i. e. Brendan Eich (JavaScript), Yukihiro Matsumoto (Ruby), James Gosling (Java), Guido van Rossum (Python), Stephen R. Bourne (Bourne shell), William Nelson Joy (C shell), Rasmus Lerdorf (PHP), Dennis Ritchie (C), Bjarne Stroustrup (C++), Larry Wall (Perl), and Brad Cox (Objective-C). The graph print is available on posters and several other products on white or Rose Quartz backgrounds.]]></description>
