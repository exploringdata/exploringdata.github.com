        <h1>How Footballers Relate based on Google Searches</h1>
        <p>The <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/">footballers search relations visualization</a> is an interactive network graph showing the connections of former and current football players and managers based on searches performed on Google. The graph consists of 1106 nodes and 2880 edges.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>As a starting point I took the player names from the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/datablog/2012/dec/24/world-best-footballers-top-100-list">Guardian's Top 100 footballers</a> list as seed queries and crawled Google's search results 5 levels deep. To be included in the graph the search query's result page needs to show knowledge graph information. If a result contains related searches up to 5 of them were also performed until the maximum depth level was reached.</p>
<p>To limit the graph to persons who relate to the football topic their knowledge graph description had to contain words such as <em>footballer</em>, <em>football player</em>, <em>football manager</em>, <em>striker</em>, <em>soccer player</em>, <em>soccer coach</em>... you get the idea.</p>
<p>I generated a gexf file from the collected data, which I then processed using <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> applying Force Atlas 2 and label adjust layouts, node sizing based on degree and coloring based on modularity. The <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/">interactive version</a> is rendered with the <a href="https://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a>.</p>
<h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
<p>The resulting graph is less surprising than the <a href="/vis/programmers-search-relations/">programmer search network</a> I created before. The most connected node is <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Lionel Messi">Lionel Messi</a> with a degree of 20, somehow playing in his own league here too with <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Cristiano Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Neymar">Neymar</a> following up each with a degree of 16. The average degree in this network is 5.208 and the modularity 0.86 with 37 recognized communities.</p>
<p>Looking at the different communities one can see that they are often made up of players from the same team, e. g. an Arsenal London community around <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Bacary Sagna">Bacary Sagna</a>, an Internazionale community around <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Diego Milito">Diego Milito</a>, a Bayern Munich community around <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Bastian Schweinsteiger">Bastian Schweinsteiger</a>, and an FC Barcelona community around <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Andrés Iniesta">Andrés Iniesta</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This network graph shows only a small fraction of the football players known to Google. Freebase alone, which is one of the sources for Google's Knowledge Graph information, currently lists 104,710 <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/soccer/views/football_player">football player topics</a>.</p>
<p>Determined by the initial list of current top players, former football stars are less prominent in this network. If I had started with searches for <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Pelé">Pelé</a>, <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Franz Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, <a href="/vis/footballers-search-relations/#Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> and the likes, I'd expect a different network, but still with many active footballers, who I suppose are searched more frequently.</p>
